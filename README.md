CopulaFLM for "Gene-based Association Analysis for Bivariate Time-to-event Data through Functional Regression with Copula Models"

1.	fun_copFLM.R: contains three key functions for constructing the basis functions of the genetic effects;
2.	CopulaFLM_main.R: contains the the main code to output the results in the Table 3 and Web Figure 1, which conduct the score test under the Copula-based FLM framework and other tests as comparisons (Cox-Rst, SKAT, Burden, and CoxFLM).
3.	The files "lefteye.csv" and "righteye.csv" contain the two margins of 2296 patients in the AREDS study, with the outcome being the time to late-AMD.
4.	The files "CFH_5000.csv", "C2_5000.csv", "ARMS2region_5000.csv" and "C3_5000.csv" contain the SNP information in the four gene regions described in the manuscript, Section 4.1.
